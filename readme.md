Python Script to take a list of directories, recurse through them through all subdirectories and file files that match a dictionary of extensions. If a file is found it will run [comskip](http://www.kaashoek.com/comskip/) against it, unless there if already an EDL file for the video. This does 10 files in a run, meant to be run on a cronjob to eventually process all videos.

This is intended to be used in a [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) media library - hopefully [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) will add support for EDL files in the near future since they are now in the BETA testing the [Plex DVR](https://www.plex.tv/features/dvr/).
